# CODSOFT
Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This collection showcases various tasks and projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of my learning journey in Python, including assignments from my internship at Codesoft. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic functionality to more complex applications.  
The To-Do List Application is a simple yet effective task management tool built using Python. This project was one of my early steps into creating functional applications, helping me understand the basics of file handling, data persistence, and user interaction in Python.
The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is a fun and interactive Python project where you can play the classic hand game against the computer. This project is a great example of how simple programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, and randomization can be combined to create an engaging user experience.
he Contact Book Application is a Python-based tool designed to help users manage their contact information efficiently. With this application, you can store, update, search, and delete contacts, making it easy to keep your contact list organized and up-to-date. This project was developed as part of my internship at Codesoft, where I aimed to create a practical and user-friendly application.
